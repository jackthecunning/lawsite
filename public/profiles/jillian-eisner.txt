She holds a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting from the University of Maryland, where she was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority. Her background in business and accounting provides valuable analytical insight when handling cases involving financial complexities and commercial disputes.

Prior to joining Swartz Campbell, Ms. Eisner served as staff counsel at a major insurance company, where she litigated hundreds of automobile first-party (UIM/UM) and third-party claims at the arbitration, trial, and federal court levels. This experience provided her with a unique understanding of insurance company perspectives and case evaluation strategies.
