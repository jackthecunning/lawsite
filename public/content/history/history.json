        "In 1921, C. Donald Swartz and William T. Campbell—two young and ambitious attorneys who had worked together as law clerks—decided to start their own practice. The newly-established firm, Swartz Campbell, offered specialized defense services focused on insurance-related matters to clients in the Philadelphia area.",
        "The small firm grew in size and reputation as the attorneys' skill and dedication gained wider recognition within the legal community. With the addition of Ward Henry—an respected solo practitioner—Swartz, Campbell & Henry continued to thrive. After Henry's retirement, a bright and energetic trial lawyer, Lynn L. Detweiler, joined the team. Swartz, Campbell & Detweiler would soon become one of the pre-eminent insurance defense firms in Philadelphia."

      "content": [
        "As the 20th century progressed, the legal environment became increasingly complex, marked by the establishment of new, specialized areas of litigation. In response, Swartz Campbell expanded its practice to meet these evolving client needs, developing teams to address workers compensations, products liability, and medical malpractice matters. Later, a dedicated motor vehicle and transportation department was established, as well as a professional liability group. Our attorneys became renowned statewide for their experience and expertise in these critical new practice areas.",
        "Then, in response to the surge of litigation in the U.S. in the 1990s, Swartz Campbell broadened its reach to Pittsburgh, New Jersey, Ohio, and Delaware. This expansion proved essential in meeting the needs of its clients—particularly major insurers and national corporations—who required consistent, high-quality legal defense across multiple jurisdictions."
