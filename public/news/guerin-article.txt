Personal Injury Victory in Guerin v. Metropolitan Insurance

Swartz Campbell achieved a significant victory for our client in Guerin v. Metropolitan Insurance, securing a substantial settlement in a complex personal injury case involving disputed insurance coverage and liability issues.

The case arose from a serious motor vehicle accident that left our client, Patricia Guerin, with multiple injuries requiring extensive medical treatment and rehabilitation. The insurance company initially denied coverage, claiming the policy had lapsed, and disputed the extent of Ms. Guerin's injuries.

Our legal team, led by Attorney Robert Chen, conducted thorough discovery and worked with medical experts to document the full extent of our client's injuries and future care needs. "Insurance companies often try to minimize claims, but we were able to prove both coverage and the true impact of this accident on Ms. Guerin's life," Chen explained.

The case required extensive litigation over policy interpretation and medical evidence. Through careful analysis of the insurance contract and testimony from treating physicians, we demonstrated that coverage was in effect at the time of the accident and that the insurer's denial was improper.

Ms. Guerin expressed gratitude for the firm's dedication throughout the two-year legal process. "I didn't know how I would manage the medical bills and lost wages," she said. "The team at Swartz Campbell fought for me when I couldn't fight for myself."

The confidential settlement provides Ms. Guerin with compensation for her medical expenses, lost income, pain and suffering, and ongoing care needs. The resolution allows her to focus on her recovery without the financial stress of mounting medical bills.

This case demonstrates our commitment to protecting the rights of accident victims and holding insurance companies accountable when they wrongfully deny valid claims. We continue to advocate for injured clients throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
