                    Expanding Expertise: Adapting to a Changing Legal Landscape Where the title is allowed to go as far as needed
                              In 1921, C. Donald Swartz and William T. Campbell—two young
                              and ambitious attorneys who had worked together as law clerks
                              —decided to start their own practice. The newly-established             ___________________________________

                    Title 2: Adapting to a Changing Legal Landscape Where the title is allowed to go as far as needed

                                        As the 20th century progressed, the legal environment became
                                        increasingly complex, marked by the establishment of new,
                                        specialized areas of litigation. In response, Swartz Campbell

 |                                 |    liability, and medical malpractice matters. Later, a dedicated
 |                                 |    motor vehicle and transportation department was established,
 |                                 |    as well as a professional liability group. Our attorneys became

                                        meeting the needs of its clients—particularly major insurers and
                                        national corporations—who required consistent, high-quality
                                        legal defense across multiple jurisdictions.
